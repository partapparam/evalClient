    title: "Why use Eval?",
    content: `1. Goal number one is to give home service employees and businesses a voice. Businesses throughout the country are constantly being reviewed on multiple platforms.    We hear more and more stories about small businesses being extorted over online reviews.  Eval is here to help balance the review system. 
    2.  Our second goal is to help businesses with their most significant unknown factor when bidding on a job: what will it be like to work with this prospect?  Home service providers are very good at determining the time and materials a job will require. However, it’s impossible to know if the customer will be why the job goes great or horribly.  With authentic reviews, EVAL can help businesses avoid bad customers and find more customers who fall into the good and great categories.

    title: "Who should I write reviews about?",
    content: `Anyone homeowner who has requested you to provide an estimate or agreed for you to do work at their home.  If you give an estimate to a prospect and your experience with them is good, write them a review.  Remember, a prospect choosing not to purchase from you doesn’t necessarily mean they deserve a bad review.

    title: "Can my reviews cause any legal issues for me?",
    content: `Yes, they can.  There are three areas that you need to be aware of.
Tell the truth.  You could be found guilty of slander if you post lies about a customer.  When in doubt, leave it out.

You should never share private information about the customer that may put them or their property at risk.  An example is that you were working on the basement safe or used the hidden key by the back door.  When in doubt, leave it out.

Do not post personal details about a customer in a protected group.  There is no need to share personal details about a customer.  Examples are but are not limited to their job, sexual orientation, race, ETC.  When in doubt, leave it out.
Lastly, we are not lawyers, and the above statements are not legal advice.  They are merely guidelines to keep you out of trouble.  In short, the things that could get you into a legal situation are not helpful to post in the first place.  In the end, a review that is 100% helpful to others does not need any information that could land you in legal trouble.
