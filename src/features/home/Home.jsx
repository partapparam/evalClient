                    1. Our first mission is to give home service employees a
                    voice. Businesses though out the country are constantly
                    being reviewed on multiple platforms. We hear more and more
                    stories of companies being extorted over online reviews.
                    Eval is here to help you avoid terrible customers and find
                    more customers that fall into the good and great categories

                    2. Our second mission is to help businesses with their most
                    significant unknown factor when bidding on a job; what will
                    it be like to work with this prospect? Home service
                    providers are very good at determining the time and
                    materials a job will require. However, it is impossible to
                    know if the customer will be why the job goes great or
                    horribly.

                    For Eval to work, we need users to review as many customers
                    as possible. We all tend to only post bad experiences;
                    however, for the platform to be helpful positive reviews
                    will be even more important. Imagine a day when your
                    customers ask you for reviews just like you ask them.
