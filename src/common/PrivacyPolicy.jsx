      <h3>GENERAL PROVISIONS</h3>
      <p>
        You agree that no joint venture, agency, partnership, or employment
        relationship exists between you and the EVAL and/or affiliates as a
        result of this Agreement or use of this Website. Our performance of this
        Agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing
        contained in this Agreement limits our right to comply with law
        enforcement or other governmental or legal requests or requirements
        relating to your use of this Website or information provided to or
        gathered by us with respect to such use. To the extent allowed by
        applicable law, you agree that you will bring any claim or cause of
        action arising from or relating to your access or use of this Website
        within two (2) years from the date on which such claim or action arose
        or accrued or such claim or cause of action will be irrevocably waived.
        If any part of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or
        unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to,
        the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then
        the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a
        valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the
        original provision and the remaining provisions in the Agreement shall
        continue in effect. This Agreement (and any other terms and conditions
        referenced herein) constitutes the entire agreement between you and EVAL
        with respect to this Website and it supersedes all prior or
        contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral,
        or written, between the customer and EVAL with respect to this Website.
        A printed version of this Agreement and of any notice given in
        electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative
        proceedings based upon or relating to this Agreement to the same extent
        and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and
        records originally generated and maintained in printed form. Fictitious
        names of companies, products, people, characters, and/or data mentioned
        on this Website are not intended to represent any real individual,
